# virus-cleanup-tool
An automation tool for renaming file extensions.
It allows you to change the file extensions of files which you would want to change after your computer was infected by a virus and you can not rename the filenames manually due to it's large volume.

## How it works
1. Make Sure that the folder of the files you would want to rename are in the same directory as the automation scripts. Example, In the virus-cleanup-tool there are two folders: flash-disk and flash-disk-test which were for the purpose of testing the functionality of the tool.
2. Run the main.py script on the terminal.
3. On running the main.py, the terminal will prompt you to ENTER name of the folder to work on so try to type the correct name.
4. After the tool has finished it's work, The terminal will display a "Done!" message indicating that the process is finished and a logs.txt file will be produced to indicate all the changes made.

GOOD LUCK!!
